# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! üëã

Hi there! I'm a Computer Science and Data Science student at **Rutgers University** with a passion for machine learning, data analysis, and software development. I thrive on solving complex problems using data-driven approaches and am constantly exploring new techniques to optimize machine learning models.

## About Me ‚ú®

- **Education**: Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Data Science (with honors) from Rutgers University
- **GPA**: 4.0/4.0
- **Research Interests**: Machine Learning, Data Science, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing
- **Certifications**: AWS Certified Developer ‚Äì Associate, AI Skills Challenge (Microsoft), PyTorch Essential Training

## üî• Key Projects 

Here are some of the projects I‚Äôve worked on:

### [**Image Colorizer**](https://github.com/DanialMustafa/Image-Colorizer)
Developed a deep learning model inspired by the *"Colorful Image Colorization"* paper to colorize grayscale images in the LAB color space. Optimized the architecture to handle dimension mismatches, achieving realistic results for landscapes.

### [**College Tuition Prediction**](https://github.com/JeevanandanRamasamy/College-Tuition-Prediction)
Built an XGBoost-based model to predict college tuition using SAT scores, Pell Grant rates, faculty salary, and demographics, achieving the lowest RMSE in a class competition.

### [**StockBot - Discord Stock Simulator**](https://github.com/JeevanandanRamasamy/StockBot)
Created a Discord bot to simulate stock trading, integrating real-time stock data retrieval via an API and MongoDB for efficient data storage and management.

## üíª Skills & Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Python, R, Java, C/C++
- **Machine Learning & Data Science**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn
- **Tools**: AWS, Azure ML, Jupyter Notebooks, Docker, Git, CI/CD, MongoDB

## üìö Research & Work Experience

I‚Äôve had the opportunity to contribute to research and development projects in the renewable energy sector, where I applied machine learning models to predict whale occurrence and furthered data-driven research for offshore wind energy.

- **NJ Wind Institute Research Fellow** ‚Äì Contributed to wind energy and whale conservation projects, co-authoring a paper accepted for publication by Nature Scientific Reports.
- **Undergraduate Researcher** ‚Äì Expanding on previous research to integrate temporal data into machine learning models for better prediction accuracy.
